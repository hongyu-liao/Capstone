The top section, labeled "Data Preparation," outlines the initial steps. Starting with "Dataset collection," an icon depicts a coastal scene with boats and water, suggesting data acquisition from environmental sensors or similar sources. This flows to "Data preprocessing," represented by an icon of interlocking gears within a container, indicating cleaning and transformation processes. Next is "Data visualization," shown as a bar graph icon, implying exploratory data analysis. Finally, "Data splitting" is depicted with an icon resembling stacked blocks, signifying the division of the dataset into training, validation, and testing sets. Arrows connect each step in sequence.

The bottom section, labeled "Model Development & Prediction," details the subsequent steps. It begins with "Save model," represented by a folder icon, indicating storage of the trained model. This leads to "Forecasting," depicted as a line graph showing an upward trend, representing predictions based on the model. Next is "Model training," shown as an icon of gears turning, symbolizing the learning process. The final step is "Attention-BiLSTM," illustrated with a schematic diagram of an Attention-BiLSTM neural network architecture. This diagram shows two stacked LSTM layers (BiLSTM) with input vectors x_t, x_(t-1), ..., x_(t-n) feeding into them.  Each LSTM layer has hidden states h_t, h_(t-1), ..., h_(t-n). An attention mechanism is depicted as a series of connected nodes and arrows pointing from the hidden states to a weighted sum, labeled y_t, y_(t-1), ..., y_(t-n). Arrows connect each step in sequence. The overall flow indicates a sequential process from data acquisition to model training and ultimately forecasting using an Attention-BiLSTM network.

Picture 11 AI Description:
TYPE: CONCEPTUAL
DETAILED_DESCRIPTION: The image depicts a simplified diagram of a bidirectional recurrent neural network (BRNN). It illustrates the flow of information through two layers: a forward layer and a backward layer. At the bottom, labeled "Inputs," are several nodes represented by ellipses with labels "...t-1", "0", and "0+1...", extending to infinity in both directions. These inputs connect via arrows to three circular nodes arranged horizontally in the middle, representing the forward layer. The nodes of the forward layer are labeled as h-1, h, and h+1, each also represented by an ellipse with a horizontal bar above it (indicating average or mean).  These forward layer nodes then connect to another set of three similar circular nodes on top, representing the backward layer, also labeled h-1, h, and h+1. The backward layer nodes are also represented by ellipses with a horizontal bar above them. Arrows indicate connections between the inputs and the forward layer, between the forward and backward layers, and from the backward layer to the "Outputs" at the top, which are similarly represented as an infinite sequence of nodes labeled "...t-1", "0", and "0+1...". The diagram clearly shows a bidirectional flow of information – input feeding into both forward and backward layers, and outputs derived from both.

Picture 12 AI Description:
TYPE: DATA_VISUALIZATION
DETAILED_DESCRIPTION: The image is a line graph depicting sea surface temperature over time. The x-axis represents time in days, ranging from 0 to 220 days. The y-axis represents sea surface temperature in degrees Celsius (°C), ranging from approximately 15°C to 23°C.

Picture 14 AI Description:
TYPE: DATA_VISUALIZATION
DETAILED_DESCRIPTION: The graph displays a comparison of actual and predicted sea surface temperatures over a period of 220 days. The x-axis represents time in days, ranging from 0 to 220. The y-axis represents the sea surface temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from approximately 15°C to 24°C. Two lines are plotted on the graph: an actual temperature line (red) and a predicted temperature line (blue). The actual temperature line starts at roughly 16°C at day 0 and steadily increases over time, exhibiting some fluctuations around its upward trend. By day 220, it reaches approximately 23.5°C. The predicted temperature line begins slightly below the actual temperature, starting at about 15.5°C at day 0. It initially remains relatively flat for the first 60 days before gradually increasing and closely following the trend of the actual temperature line from around day 70 onwards. By day 220, it reaches approximately 23°C. The graph suggests a reasonable degree of accuracy in the prediction model, particularly as time progresses. A legend identifies the red line as "Actual" and the blue line as "Predicted."

Picture 15 AI Description:
TYPE: DATA_VISUALIZATION
DETAILED_DESCRIPTION: The graph displays a time series of sea surface temperature data alongside a predicted temperature trend. The x-axis represents time in days, ranging from approximately 0 to 220 days. The y-axis represents sea surface temperature in degrees Celsius, ranging from roughly 16°C to 23°C. Two lines are plotted on the graph: an "Actual" line (red) and a "Predicted" line (blue). Initially, both lines fluctuate around 16°C for the first ~50 days. Starting around day 50, both lines begin to increase in temperature, with the actual temperature generally trending higher than the predicted temperature. The actual temperature peaks at approximately 22-23°C between days 140 and 180. After this peak, the actual temperature decreases slightly, while the predicted temperature remains relatively stable before also decreasing towards the end of the time series (around day 220). Overall, the predicted line closely follows the trend of the actual data, but with some deviations, particularly during periods of rapid change and at higher temperatures.

Picture 11 Web Summary:
Query: Bidirectional RNN Recurrent Neural Network
Summary: Bidirectional Recurrent Neural Networks (BRNNs) are an extension of traditional recurrent neural networks designed to leverage more contextual information. Essentially, a BRNN combines two unidirectional RNN layers – one processing the input sequence forward in time and another processing it backward. This architecture allows the network to consider both past and future elements when making predictions or generating outputs, providing a richer understanding of the data's context. Invented in 1997, BRNNs achieve this by chaining these two RNN layers together, connecting their hidden layers to a shared output layer. The concept is relatively straightforward: transforming an existing unidirectional RNN into a bidirectional one is a simple process. This capability proves particularly useful in tasks where understanding the surrounding context is crucial, such as natural language processing.
