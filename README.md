# PDF Extraction and Picture Description - Capstone Project (README.md Generated by AI)

A system that extracts images from PDF documents and uses AI to analyze and describe them.

## Project Overview

This project processes PDF documents to:
1. Extract images and text using Docling
2. Analyze images with LM Studio's vision models
3. Generate text descriptions to replace images
4. Create clean outputs for further processing

## File Description

### Main Files

- **`PDF_extract_and_Picture_Describe.ipynb`** - Main processing notebook
  - Extracts images from PDF files
  - Uses LM Studio to analyze and describe images
  - Creates enhanced JSON with AI-generated descriptions
  - Includes web search integration for additional context

- **`json2html.ipynb`** - Converts JSON outputs to HTML format
  - Takes processed JSON files and creates viewable HTML
  - Handles both original and cleaned versions
  - Includes fallback methods when conversion fails

- **`test.ipynb`** - Testing and experimentation notebook
  - Used for testing different approaches and parameters

- **`temp.py`** - Simple utility script
  - Counts the number of images in a JSON file
  - Useful for quick verification

### Folders

- **`Sample Papers/`** - Input PDF documents
  - Contains 3 sample research papers for testing
  - Covers topics like climate science and marine research

- **`output_lmstudio_conversion/`** - Generated outputs
  - Original JSON files with embedded images
  - NLP-ready JSON files (images removed, descriptions added)
  - HTML files for viewing
  - Verification reports

- **`scratch/`** - Alternative processing experiments
  - Contains outputs from different processing methods

- **`temp_extraction_folder/`** - Temporary storage
  - Used during image extraction process
  - Gets cleaned up automatically

### Key Outputs

- **`*.json`** - Original extracted content with images
- **`*_nlp_ready.json`** - Clean version with text descriptions instead of images
- **`*.html`** - Viewable HTML versions
- **`*_verification_report.txt`** - Processing logs and verification

## Setup Requirements

1. Install Python packages: `docling`, `requests`, `duckduckgo-search`
2. Set up LM Studio with a vision model (we used `google/gemma-3-12b-it-gguf`)
3. Run LM Studio server on `http://localhost:1234`

## How It Works

1. **PDF Processing**: Load PDF → Extract images and text → Save as JSON
2. **Image Analysis**: Analyze each image → Generate descriptions → Add web context
3. **Cleaning**: Remove image data → Keep descriptions → Create NLP-ready version
4. **Verification**: Check that all AI content was properly integrated

## Notes

- Processing takes time due to AI analysis of each image
- Requires internet connection for web search features
- LM Studio must be running with the correct model loaded
- Some images are automatically filtered out (logos, decorative elements)
