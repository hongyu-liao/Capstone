                    The chart is a line graph that shows the scores of four different models on three different metrics: OPUS, NLLB 600M, and ChatGPT-3.5. The x-axis represents the different models, while the y-axis represents the scores. The chart shows that the OPUS model has the lowest score, while the ChatGPT-3.5 model has the highest score. The NLLB 600M model has a score that is somewhere between the OPUS and NLLB 600M models, and the CO model has a score that is somewhere between the NLLB 600M and CO models.

                    The chart is a line graph that shows the performance scores of different models on six different tasks. The x-axis represents the task names, while the y-axis represents the score. Each line represents a different model, and the scores are plotted along the y-axis. The chart also includes a legend that identifies each model and its corresponding score. The chart is visually appealing and easy to understand.
